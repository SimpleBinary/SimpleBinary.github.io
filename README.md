<p>Well, I wanted to remake my website, and I thought,</p>
<p>Well, Making websites is always quite similar, HTML and CSS</p>
<p>So, I decided to change it a bit, to challenge myself.</p>
<p>Thats why I decided <i>not</i> to use css, but to use w3.css instead, which I have never used before</p>
<p>After attempting w3.css, I realised 2 things</p>
<p><b>1. How much I like css</b></p>
<p><b>2. How much I don't like w3.css</b></p>
<p> Its not done yet, or even close, but it will be done soon!</p>
<p>Coming to you in 2018</p>
